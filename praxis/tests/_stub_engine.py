"""Shared test helper: a stub corpora engine.

The sequence scripts (chunk_ledger, ratify_writeback, kill_graduation, domain_import, domain_migrate)
own ordering, preconditions, and guards; the engine verbs themselves are corpora's. To test the
orchestration without corpora present, we point each script's `--corpus-py` at a generated stub that
(1) appends its full argv to a log file so a test can assert *which verbs ran, in what order*, and
(2) exits non-zero for verbs a test names as failing, so the guard/stop logic can be exercised.
