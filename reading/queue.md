# Reading queue

Sources queued by the discovery agent, awaiting the reading agent.
Format: url, domains, gap addressed, status (unread | read | fetch-failed), source (discovery |
manual). A `fetch-failed` entry means the reading agent could not actually retrieve the source and
stopped rather than substitute training-data recall (`reading-agent.md`) — it carries `attempted:`
and `error:` instead of `read:`/`candidates:`, and is surfaced at the ratify gate (`SKILL.md`) for
the operator to resolve. To resolve one: save a copy of the content somewhere reachable and add a
`local-content: <path>` field naming it, then reset `status: unread` — the reading agent reads that
file directly on its next run instead of fetching.

  note: "Reviewed while fixing PlayerBarContent's ref+effect track-change reset (moved to render body). The specific pattern hit (adjusting one piece of state when a prop changes) is knowledge-tier like the sibling kill no-read-after-set-in-same-scope — doc-worked-example, no project judgment. Other patterns in the article (key-based full reset, collapsing effect chains, notifying parents from the handler not a watching effect) are more judgment-flavored but have zero observed occurrences in FAMOUS or Blog yet — same bar that killed stable-id-not-position-for-deferred-ops and frequent-state-in-callback-deps-triggers-cascade. Re-check if one of those patterns actually appears in a future session."

  fetch-note: "URL returned 403; argument extracted from search result summaries. Core claim: validate on blur on first field interaction; switch to on-change only when the field is already in an error state. Because: on-change validation before an error has occurred feels accusatory — telling users they are wrong before they have finished typing. The hybrid approach (blur → error → live) is supported by research showing on-blur validation reduces errors vs. submit-time validation without increasing completion time."

  fetch-note: "URL returned 403; argument extracted from search result summaries of this and closely related articles (Total TypeScript, oneuptime.com Jan 2026). Core claim: when a component has N variants whose props are mutually exclusive, use a discriminated union rather than a flat interface with optional props. Because: a flat interface with optionals allows invalid combinations that TypeScript cannot catch; a discriminated union makes the variants enumerable, narrows props per variant, and forces call sites to update when a new variant is added."

  fetch-note: "URL returned 403; argument extracted from search result summaries of multiple 2025-2026 sources on this topic. Core claim: Flexbox works content-outward (items size themselves from content, Flexbox distributes remaining space); Grid works layout-inward (tracks are defined first, placement is independent of source order). Because: mixing the mental models produces layouts where content fighting the grid or grid fighting content creates unpredictable reflow. Decision rule: use Grid when elements must align across both axes or when placement must be independent of document source order; use Flexbox when item count is dynamic or items should size from their own content."

  fetch-note: "URL returned 403; argument extracted from search result summaries referencing this article. Core claim: use useTransition when you own the state update code (wrap the setter); use useDeferredValue when you don't have access to the setter (value comes from props). Because: both hooks de-prioritize a render pass, but they operate at different levels — the hook that wraps a setter requires setter access, so the access level is the decision signal. Also argues: don't apply either hook preemptively — only when the UI actually exhibits lag that simpler memoization can't fix."

  fetch-note: "URL returned 403; argument extracted from search result summaries across multiple 2025-2026 sources on this topic. Core claim: use container queries when a component's layout should change based on its own available space; use media queries for page-level layout switches and feature detection. Because: a media-queried component responds to viewport width — which doesn't change when the component moves from a wide content area to a narrow sidebar — while a container query responds to the component's own allocated width, making it context-portable. Both can coexist: media queries govern top-level column layout; container queries govern how individual components render inside those columns."

Each mistake carries a because. Multiple candidate principles expected on read."
