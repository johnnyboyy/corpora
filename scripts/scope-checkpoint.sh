# corpora PostToolUse hook — periodic scope/integrity checkpoint nudge.
#
# Backs spawn-integrity's periodic-scope-and-integrity-checkpoint principle: a spawn noticing its
# own scope has drifted mid-task (not just attention degrading, which checkpoint-on-context-
# pressure-tell already covers) is easy to miss without an external prompt, the same way
# self-initiated checking erodes under the pressure that principle documents. This hook is that
# external prompt.
#
# Deliberately no python/jq here — this fires on every tool call for the whole session, so the
# steady-state cost (the common case: silent, no reminder due yet) has to be a few filesystem ops,
# not an interpreter startup. Only the Nth call actually emits anything.
#
# State is a per-session counter file, not a shared one — a fresh session (main agent or a spawned
# subagent, each gets its own session_id) starts counting from zero, so the interval is per spawn's
# own tool-call stream, matching the principle's own scope ("during a spawn's session").
#
# Register in ~/.claude/settings.json (user-level, so it's active for every corpora-managed
# project; the corpora/config.md check below makes it a no-op everywhere else):

Periodic checkpoint (spawn-integrity's periodic-scope-and-integrity-checkpoint): compare your
current diff/output against this task's original stated scope. If it has grown to cover materially
different or additional concerns — not just more effort than expected — stop at the next safe
point, set status: blocked, name the divergence observed, and describe in Surfaced exactly what's
done and what remains. If scope still matches, no action needed.
