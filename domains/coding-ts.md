# Domain: coding-ts

Framework-agnostic JS/TS code patterns — language and module-system judgment that holds regardless
of which UI framework the project uses. Named for TypeScript rather than JS: TypeScript is this
domain's default language, even where a given principle's underlying fact would also hold in plain
JS. Loaded by any convergent coding spawn when `language` is `typescript` or `javascript`. Audit
metadata lives in `domains/audit.md`, loaded only at ratify/retrospective time.

Settled JS/TS style, held here in the preamble rather than in `principles:` — both are JS
instances of the base `coding-general` meta-rules, near-unconditional enough that per-case
condition-weighing is friction without benefit (provenance: `domains/audit.md`):

- **Block arrow bodies always** (`() => { return value; }`) — `{}` after an arrow is a function
  body, not a value; the concise form has a silent failure mode and forces a per-function judgment
  call.
- **No early returns or guard clauses** — use if/else block bodies. Indentation should encode the
  conditions under which each line runs: an early return lets a line that needs two conditions to
  be true sit at the function's base indentation as if it needs nothing, while if/else puts it
  where it belongs. A flat row of guards whose order doesn't matter is not a case for keeping
  them; it is a signal to extract and name the combined condition
  (`const error = validateRequest(req)`), after which if/else costs nothing. Scoped to this pack
  because some ecosystems (e.g. Go) idiomatically prefer guard clauses — the reasoning itself is
  general. See also: `no-shell-for-structural-absence`, below — the narrower case of a branch with
  no true opposite side, which this reasoning was never meant to force into a populated shell.

principles:

- id: undefined-check-by-source
  rule: "Match the equality operator to the source of the value: an optional object field typed `Value | undefined` uses `=== undefined` / `!== undefined`; array element access and `Array.find()` results also use `!== undefined`. Never `== null` for either."
  condition: "When guarding any value that may be absent — an optional object field, array element access, or `Array.find()` results."
  reason: "Both sources yield `undefined`, not `null` — distinguishing them by name keeps intent clear at the point of use. A loose `== null` silently absorbs both, hiding which case actually occurred."

- id: named-exports-over-default
  rule: "Prefer named exports over export default. Export a binding under the name it's defined with, and import it by that same name."
  condition: "When adding or refactoring a JS/TS module's exports."
  reason: "A default export lets every importer choose its own local name for the same binding, so the same value can appear under different names across the codebase, and find-references / auto-import tooling has no canonical name to anchor on. Named exports fix the name at the source, so grep and IDE find-references locate every consumer reliably."

- id: same-state-same-name
  rule: "When two sibling types have states that produce the same visual output, unify the state vocabulary before extracting a shared renderer. A naming mismatch signals the same concept split across two types — rename first, then the shared function compiles without casting."
  condition: "When two types have parallel state fields that map to identical visual output, differing only in the name of the base/default state."
  reason: "Separate names for the same visual concept force either a translation layer or casts at the merge point. Renaming removes the impedance mismatch and makes the subset relationship structurally visible to TypeScript — the narrower type becomes assignable to the wider one without casting."

- id: nan-serializes-to-null-in-json
  rule: "Never store NaN in state that will be JSON-serialized. Use undefined for 'not yet entered' — JSON.stringify omits it; NaN becomes null and silently corrupts reads. The ?? operator does not catch NaN (NaN is not null/undefined)."
  condition: "Any controlled numeric input whose onChange handler parses with parseFloat or parseInt, or any state that is JSON.stringify'd to a serialization boundary."
  reason: "JSON.stringify(NaN) === 'null'. An input cleared to '' → parseFloat('') → NaN → ??(default) still evaluates to NaN. That NaN reaches localStorage as null, breaking any consumer that assumes the TypeScript number type."
  see-also: numeric-inputs-start-empty-not-zero

- id: no-shell-for-structural-absence
  rule: "If one side of a conditional is a true structural absence — not skipped logic, just nothing to do by definition — don't wrap it in an if/else. Reach for a construct that has no empty branch to begin with, e.g. filter."
  condition: "A branch where one outcome does nothing at all — typically filtering a collection or checking a predicate."
  reason: "An empty branch beside a real one gives 'nothing happens' the same weight as the real case, though it's incidental, not meaningful. Making it explicit then forces a stray empty block or a comment that just restates the condition. A branchless construct has nothing to fill or comment. Narrower than this domain's 'no early returns' preamble convention, above — that convention was never meant to force a true structural absence into a populated if/else shell."

- id: stable-id-not-position-for-deferred-ops
  rule: "When recording state for a deferred operation (undo, redo, queue, bookmark), store the item's stable identity, never its current position in a filtered, sorted, or paginated view."
  kill_type: quality
  reason_killed: "Zero fires across Blog and FAMOUS. Condition (undo/redo/queue/bookmark) has not appeared in either project. A principle that never fires is ambient noise."

- id: font-mono-at-element-not-container
  rule: "Apply font-mono to the individual element containing code-register data — not to a wrapper div."
  kill_type: quality
  reason_killed: "Fired once (Blog FixedBottomResultsBar, 2026-06-13). Has not recurred in FAMOUS. A correct choice a coder makes from first principles when they see the symptom."
