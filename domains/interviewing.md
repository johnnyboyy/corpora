# Domain: interviewing

Judgment about conducting a clarifying dialogue and framing a question so it's cheap to answer —
distinct from `orchestrator-routing`'s judgment about *whether* to ask and *who* owns the answer,
and from `planning`'s judgment about decomposing a capability once ambiguity is resolved.
Stance-agnostic: consumed by any lens that hits a genuine clarifying moment, not owned by a single
lens and not restricted to convergent ones — a divergent spawn's own dialogue (e.g. `ui-design`
narrowing to two aesthetic-direction questions during bootstrap) needs the same discipline. Seeded
2026-07-22 from decomposing `planner.md`'s "Dialogue" step and absorbing `orchestrator-routing`'s
`surface-design-questions-neutrally` (see that principle's audit history); widened 2026-07-22 from
"any convergent lens" once `ui-design`'s own clarifying-dialogue moments showed the restriction was
never load-bearing — none of the three principles below actually condition on stance. Audit
metadata lives in `domains/audit.md`, loaded only at ratify/retrospective time.

principles:

- id: ask-one-question-at-a-time
  rule: "When conducting a clarifying dialogue to resolve ambiguity, ask one question at a time and wait for the answer before asking the next."
  condition: "When multiple genuine ambiguities exist that need resolving through dialogue before proceeding."
  reason: "Asking several at once forces the answerer to hold multiple open threads simultaneously and often produces partial or scattered answers. One at a time also lets a later question be shaped by an earlier answer, rather than committing to a fixed question set up front."

- id: name-clear-direction-dont-manufacture-choice
  rule: "When there is one clear direction and no genuine alternative worth weighing, state it and ask for confirmation rather than staging a false multi-option choice."
  condition: "When framing a clarifying question during dialogue, or when surfacing a decision to the operator."
  reason: "Manufacturing options when there is no real ambiguity dresses up a non-decision as a choice, adds friction, and asks the other party to do work that isn't needed. Confirmation is cheaper and more honest about the actual state of certainty."

- id: frame-questions-for-cheap-answers
  rule: "When surfacing a question to another party, include enough framing — the subject, what decision is needed, and what context the answerer needs — to make the answer cheap. Do not include a tentative recommendation or opinion when the question is being routed for someone else's judgment, not your own."
  condition: "When asking a clarifying or direction question of the operator or of another lens, whether during a planner's dialogue, an orchestrator routing a design question outward, or any lens's `questions-pending` pause."
  reason: "Under-framed questions force the answerer to reconstruct context the asker already has; over-framed with a baked-in opinion risks anchoring the answer instead of genuinely eliciting judgment. Both failure modes are avoidable by explicitly separating 'here is the decision and its context' from 'here is what I think.'"
